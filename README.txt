This repository contains two projects an convoultional encoder that creates numerous output files from a single input file, based upon different possible permutations
of an encoder setup.
	
The second project contains an example decoder based upon the Viterbi trellis algorithm. The decoder can also inject error into encoded files and attempt to decode
it by correcting the errors
